# ProPy

An **image Editor** created using ***P5.js*** and as a part of a project *Submitted for a Linear Algebra course*

## About The Project
Product was developed for an examination and demonstration project of the linear algebra behind *image processing and image manipulating*. 
- The **editing tools** include: 
      
     *Tint, contrast, negative invert, greyscale filter, mirror reflection, and save the image option*.
- The **linear algebra concepts** explored for this project include: 
    
     *Vector addition and subtraction, matrix-vector multiplication, scalar-vector multiplication, and transpose of matrix*. 
- To **find more** about the project, and how the concepts represent and are used to implement each editing feature:
      
     *Refer to **the [Project Statement]***.
